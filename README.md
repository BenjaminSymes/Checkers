# Python Checkers Game
Python Checker Game

This is a checkers game that I worked on during IT 450 Artificial Intelligence. I did not create this program, as it was given to me by my school. The goal was to change to algorithms to increase the difficulty of the computer. To use this app, simply download python, download this program, change to the directory it is downloaed to, and type python3 Checkers_v24.py.
